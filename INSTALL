There is an small script named install.sh which should do the installation for you.

For more info refer to the wiki: http://wiki.volkszaehler.org/doku.php/howto/getstarted

== Dependencies ==

You need composer (http://getcomposer.org/).

You can either install it privately to your VZ installation (1) or system wide (2)

(1) VZ private

Suitable if you need composer only for VZ.

1. Download and execute composer installer
  curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
2. Run composer to install VZ dependencies:
  ./composer.phar install"

(2) System installation

1. Download latest composer snapshot
  wget -O /usr/local/bin/composer https://getcomposer.org/composer.phar
  chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/composer
2. Run composer to install VZ dependencies:
  composer install


Optional step:

If you are a developer, run
  composer --dev update
