volkszaehler.org uses doctrine [1] as database abstraction and object relation model.

Database Setup
==============

To setup your database follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have a proper configuration file (etc/volkszaehler.conf.php)
2. Adjust the configuration to your database setup
3. Call bin/doctrine orm:schema-tool:create --dump-sql > database.sql
4. Import the resulting file using your favorite sql tool

Alternatively you can directly import a existing .sql file or
force the script to do it for you by leaving out the --dump-sql option.


Importing Demo Data
===================

This directory contains a MySQL data dump for demonstration purposes.

Import the demo.sql file into your database for a demonstration.
